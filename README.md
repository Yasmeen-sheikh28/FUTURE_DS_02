# Customer Retention & Churn Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer subscription data to uncover churn patterns, retention trends, and customer lifetime value (CLV). It combines Python analytics, Power BI dashboards, and a written report to deliver actionable insights.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/` → Raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebook for churn analysis (`churn_analysis.ipynb`)
- `script/` → Python script for churn metrics (`churn_metrics.py`)
- `dashboards/` → Power BI dashboard (`retention_dashboard.pbix`)
- `reports/` → Final report with insights (`retention_report.docx`)
- `README.md` → Project overview
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies

## 🔍 Key Analysis Steps
- Churn rate calculation
- Retention trend visualization
- Cohort analysis by signup month
- Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) modeling
- Exported results for dashboarding

## 📈 Dashboard Highlights
Built in Power BI:
- Churn vs Retained bar chart
- Retention trend line chart
- CLV distribution histogram
- Top customers by value table

## 📄 Report Summary
The final report includes:
- Executive summary
- Key metrics and visuals
- Strategic recommendations to reduce churn

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Open `churn_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Run all cells to generate metrics
3. Export results to `churn_results.csv`
4. Open `retention_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI
5. Review insights and share report

## 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn lifetimes
